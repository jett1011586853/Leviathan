  'Manage scheduled Leviathan remote agents through a configured remote provider. Auth is handled in-process; the token never reaches the shell.'

Actions:
- list: GET /v1/code/triggers
- get: GET /v1/code/triggers/{trigger_id}
- create: POST /v1/code/triggers (requires body)
- update: POST /v1/code/triggers/{trigger_id} (requires body, partial update)
- run: POST /v1/code/triggers/{trigger_id}/run

The response is the raw JSON from the API.`
